# Warehouse-System

University project for a made-up warehouse system which had the goal
to practice implementing web services for a system as well as
running a system using a tool for orchestrating containers(Docker).

Main tools that were used are Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy
libraries and Docker in swarm mode. Dissected parts of the system
were made into Docker Images that were then used for running
corresponding containers.

There are 3 roles in the system: admin, buyer and warehouseman.
The system provides a way for users to register, as well as corresponding
possibilites for their roles. All the endpoints explained in detail can be 
found in the docs/pdf file.
